Testing:
	Edit rigcmd.h and define _YY_BASE_TEST
	Edit base.y to reflect new grammatic constructs.
	Do 'make base'
	Run base, type new command(s), verify proper operation.
	Repeat until base grammar is working.
	Edit rigcmd.h and undefine _YY_BASE_TEST
	Edit parser.y to reflect *working* grammar.

Build:
	cd ${SRCDIR}/tests/rc; make	# only if parser has changed
	cd ${BLDDIR}; make		
	su; make install

Files:	parser.y		# Grammar, semantics, and actions
	scanner.l		# lexical scanner
	lex_rigs.h		# Model symbols from rig_list.h
	# all remaining files are generated.  do not edit
