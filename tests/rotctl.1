.SH NAME
rotctl \- control antenna rotators
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotctl
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fICOMMAND\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Control antenna rotators.
\fBrotctl\fP accepts \fBcommands\fP from command line as well as in
interactive mode if none provided in command line.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
Keep in mind that \fBHamlib\fP is still ALPHA level software. 
A lof of stuff hasn't been tested thoroughly, and the API may change
without publicised notice. Please report bugs and feedback at
the e-mail address given in the REPORTING BUGS section.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-model=id
Select rotator model number. See model list.
.TP
.B \-r, --rot-file=device
Use \fBdevice\fP as the file name of the rotator to operate.
.TP
.B \-s, --serial-speed=baud
Set serial speed to \fBbaud\fP rate. Uses maximal rotator speed as default.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-show-conf
List all config parameters.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-set\-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]*
Set config parameter.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List all model numbers and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Set verbose mode, cumulative (BUG, ERR, WARN, VERBOSE, TRACE).
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program and exit.

.SH COMMANDS
Commands can be entered either as a single char, or as a long command name.
Basically, the commands do not take a dash in front of them, as
the options usually do. They may be typed in when in interactive mode
or provided as argument in command line interface mode.
Since most of the Hamlib operations have a \fIset\fP and a \fIget\fP method,
upper case letter will be used for \fIset\fP method whereas the corresponding
lower case letter refers to the \fIget\fP method.
.PP
Please note that the backend for the rotator to be controlled, 
or the rotator itself may not support some commands. In that case, 
the operation will fail with a standard error message.
.PP
A summary of commands is included below.
.TP
.B P, set_pos
Set position: azimuth and elevation.
.TP
.B p, get_pos
Get position: azimuth and elevation.
.TP
.B K, park
Park the antenna.
.TP
.B S, stop
Stop the rotator.
.TP
.B R, reset
Reset the rotator.
.TP
.B M, move
Move the rotator in a spesific direction.
.TP
.B _, get_info
Get misc information on the rotator.

.SH RETURN VALUE
rotctl exits with:
0 if all operations went fine; 1 if there was an invalid command line
option or arg; or 2 if an error was returned by Hamlib.
