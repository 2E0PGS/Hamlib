<H2>Preface</H2>
<P>This document describes the \e Hamlib library API for 1.1.4.
Each function of the API occuring in rig.c at the time of release 
is documented here.  Every effort was made to ensure all arguments 
and return values are correct, but, as always, the source is definitive.
Errors are bound to have occurred and others will be blamed.</P>
